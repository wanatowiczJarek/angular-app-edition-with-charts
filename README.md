# Angular Coding Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to test your coding style, ability to work with libraries/frameworks documentation and to develop features using Angular.

After task completion we will discuss your solution together during the interview and talk about the decisions you have made and solutions you proposed.

Please do as much as you can in a few hours.


## Getting Started

Copy this template repository and use nx monorepo workspace starter we provided to start coding. App is in apps directory and libraries in libs directory. At the end of this readme you have default readme tips provided by nx. For further information about coding in Nx Workspace please use their docs/tutorials etc..


## The App
You will be building entity location app that contain entity list, entity details and location stats page. Please create app that fulfill requirements provided below.

### Overall requirements:
- use PrimeNg components library
- use Prime Icons
- for layouts and responsiveness use CSS Grid and/or Flexbox
- all views should be responsive up to 320px (mobile small)
- for charts use highcharts-angular (https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-angular)
- install dependencies if something is missing

### App Skeleton:
- fix main menu - currently menu items do not expand
- add menu responsiveness (behaviour for small screens) - pick your solution
- add app routing - follow redirectLinks for menu items defined in app.component.ts (`path: ''` should redirect to entities/homepage path where `HomepageComponent` should appear)
- `EntitiesFeatureListModule` and `EntitiesFeatureLocationDashboardModule` should be Lazy Loaded, inside that modules create proper components for List and dashboard view.

### Features:

### Feature data-repostiory library:
- API is not ready yet, but you need to deliver, so you need to create mock service `entity-mock.service.ts` that imitate real API behaviour described in `entity.service.ts`. Methods in mock service should have delay (1000 ms) on response and should randomly return error 403 with probability equals to 0.1. You should use this mock service to interact with data in developed app.
- all components should use `EntityService` for data interaction. `MockEntityService` should be used in a way that allow to switch to the target implementation (`EntityService`) by changing one file (All components that uses `EntityService` should not require changes).

### Feature Entity List
- Create entity list component in `entities-feature-list` library. 
- Display list of all entities using PrimeNG Table. 
- Table should contain all columns except entity ID. 
- if entity is inactive then in `Is Active` column for that entity you should display text: 'Inactive' with red prime icon named: `pi-exclamation-triangle`
- visibility of columns should be selectable by multiselect component and that selection should be saved in local storage and it should be read from also on list init.
- search input should be created. It should filter entity list by `name` and `trackingId`. Please have in mind that this is costly operation on backend side so be prepared.

### Feature Entity Details
- create entity details component that should appear after click on entity name in the entity list
- component should display all `EntityDetails` data
- after click on edit button it should switch to edit mode and allow to edit all three fields from the `EntityUpdateDto` where `entityType` should be selected from available types (get data from service).
- please use reactive forms
- validate for required fields
- name should be unique so please write validator that uses entities list endpoint with `GetEntityListParams` `name` field too check uniqueness.
- name should not equal to trackingId - please validate
- save button should trigger entire form validation and if form is valid it should update entity.
- after proper update user should land in the entity details page and after error should be redirected to entity list page.
- use PrimeNg MessageService to Display Toast on update success and on error.

### Feature Location Dashboard
- in `EntitiesFeatureLocationDashboardModule` create component to display location dashboard
- prepare data in `MockEntityService` for `LocationStats`. Use `lastWeekLocationOccupancy` field from mock service and map `lastWeekVisitsLog` to `lastWeekEmployeesVisits`
- display `LocationStats` data using two charts. Please select chart types appropriate for data.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve location-app`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
